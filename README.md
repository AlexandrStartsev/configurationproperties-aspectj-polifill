# configurationproperties-aspectj-polyfill
"polyfill" for @ConfigurationProperties for spring 4 (non-boot)

What it says. Use @PropertySource + @ConfigurationProperties in configurations/components. Implementation very simple and not very efficient :) but whatever. 

Add property resolution/readers/loaders at discretion.
